# Getting Started with Create React App

Using node 18.10.0 run `npm install`, then `npm run start`, then go to localhost:3000

Please read `changes.md` for more information on what changes I made.

#### Preparing the site for production
As I used create-react-app, preparing the site for production is fairly straight-forward, you'll need to run `npm run build`, which will create the production site for you, you can then setup a simple node server to serve those files.
